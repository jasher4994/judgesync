What causes seasons on Earth?,"The Earth tilts as it goes around the sun, which causes seasons. When your part of Earth tilts toward the sun, it's summer. When it tilts away, it's winter. This tilt is about 23.5 degrees.",4
Describe the water cycle.,"Water evaporates, forms clouds, then rains back down.",3
What is machine learning?,"Machine learning is when computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. The system improves through experience. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns and make decisions.",5
How does a car engine work?,"Gas explodes in cylinders, pushing pistons that turn the wheels.",2
What are the benefits of exercise?,"Exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, helps maintain healthy weight, and boosts mental health. Regular physical activity reduces risk of chronic diseases.",4
Explain supply and demand.,"When lots of people want something but there's not much of it, the price goes up. When there's lots available but few want it, price goes down.",3
What is climate change?,"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. Human activities have been the dominant driver since the 1900s, primarily through burning fossil fuels.",5
How do vaccines work?,"Vaccines train your immune system to recognize and fight specific diseases by introducing a weakened or inactive form of the pathogen.",4
What is the difference between weather and climate?,"Weather is what's happening outside right now. Climate is the average weather over many years.",3
Explain the concept of gravity.,"Everything pulls on everything else. Bigger things pull harder.",2
How does the internet work?,"The internet is a global network of connected computers that communicate using protocols like TCP/IP. Data travels through routers and servers as packets.",4

Describe the solar system.,"Our solar system has the Sun at the center with eight planets orbiting around it. Inner planets are rocky, outer planets are gas giants.",4
What causes earthquakes?,"Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates in Earth's crust suddenly move or slip past each other, releasing energy as seismic waves.",3
How do airplanes fly?,"Wings are shaped so air moves faster over the top than the bottom, creating lift. Engines provide thrust to move forward.",3
What is artificial intelligence?,"AI is technology that enables machines to simulate human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.",4
Explain the greenhouse effect.,"Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, keeping Earth warm. Human activities are increasing these gases.",3

Explain inflation.,"Inflation is when prices of goods and services increase over time, reducing the purchasing power of money.",3
What causes lightning?,"Lightning occurs when electrical charges build up in clouds and discharge to the ground or between clouds.",3
How do magnets work?,"Magnets have invisible fields that attract iron and other magnetic materials. They have north and south poles.",2
What is evolution?,"Evolution is the process by which species change over time through natural selection and genetic variation.",4
Describe the human digestive system.,"Food travels from mouth to stomach to intestines, where nutrients are absorbed. Enzymes break down food at each stage.",3
What is renewable energy?,"Energy from sources that naturally replenish, like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.",3
How do antibiotics work?,"Antibiotics kill bacteria or stop them from reproducing, helping your body fight bacterial infections.",3
What is the stock market?,"A marketplace where shares of companies are bought and sold. Prices fluctuate based on company performance and investor sentiment.",3
Explain quantum physics.,"The study of matter and energy at the smallest scales, where particles behave in strange ways unlike our everyday experience.",2
What causes tsunamis?,"Tsunamis are giant waves caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides that displace large amounts of water.",4
How does GPS work?,"GPS uses satellites orbiting Earth to triangulate your position by measuring signal travel time from multiple satellites.",3
What is blockchain?,"A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that can't be altered retroactively.",3
Describe metabolism.,"The chemical processes in your body that convert food into energy and building materials for cells.",2
What is the Big Bang theory?,"The scientific theory that the universe began from a single point about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.",4
How do electric cars work?,"Electric cars use batteries to power electric motors that turn the wheels, instead of burning gasoline in an engine.",3
What is meditation?,"A practice of focused attention and awareness to achieve mental clarity and emotional calm.",2
Explain carbon footprint.,"The total amount of greenhouse gases produced by human activities, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents.",3
What causes hurricanes?,"Hurricanes form over warm ocean water when conditions create a rotating system of clouds and wind that intensifies.",3
How does memory work?,"The brain encodes, stores, and retrieves information through connections between neurons. Short-term becomes long-term through repetition.",3
What is CRISPR?,"A gene-editing technology that allows scientists to modify DNA sequences precisely, like molecular scissors for genes.",4
Describe the immune system.,"Your body's defense network of cells and proteins that identifies and fights harmful invaders like viruses and bacteria.",3
What is dark matter?,"Invisible matter that doesn't emit light but has gravitational effects, making up most of the universe's mass.",2
